INSTALLATION 

If Module::Build is installed (preferred):

    perl Build.PL
    perl Build
    perl Build test
    perl Build install

Otherwise, using a Makefile:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

If you are on a Windows machine you should use 'nmake' or 'dmake' rather than
'make'.
